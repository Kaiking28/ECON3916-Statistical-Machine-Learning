# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my journey in **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm learning to bridge traditional economic theory with modern data science techniques.

## 👋 About Me

I'm an undergraduate economics student passionate about using data to solve real-world problems. I'm actively seeking opportunities in **data analysis** and **economic consulting**, where I can apply both rigorous economic thinking and cutting-edge analytical tools.

My goal is to demonstrate how economists can leverage machine learning not just for prediction, but to enhance causal inference and policy analysis—bridging the gap between traditional econometrics and modern data science.

## 📚 About This Portfolio

This repository contains my coursework, labs, and projects from ECON 3916. The course takes a **"Concept Extension" approach**: we start with foundational statistical concepts (like OLS regression) and scale them up using machine learning algorithms (like Lasso, Ridge, and ensemble methods).

Through this work, I'm developing skills in:
- **Causal Inference**: Understanding what drives economic outcomes
- **Predictive Analytics**: Building models that forecast and classify
- **Statistical Learning**: Applying regularization, cross-validation, and model selection
- **Economic Applications**: Translating technical results into policy-relevant insights

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This portfolio leverages modern tools for economic data analysis:

- **Python** 🐍 – Core programming language
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- **Statsmodels** – Statistical modeling and econometric analysis
- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based development environment
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – Interactive analysis and documentation

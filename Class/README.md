"I need help writing a project description for my first lab: 'Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index'.

**Important Rule:** Do NOT generate any Python code for me. I have already written the code manually to build muscle memory. I only need help with the text and economic explanation.

**What I did in this lab:**
* Objective: I used 'Burgernomics' to test the 'Law of One Price'.
* The Data: I manually built a dataset using Python dictionaries based on The Economist's 2015 Big Mac data.
* The Tech: I used Python and Pandas to calculate 'Implied PPP' and the percentage valuation of different currencies against the US Dollar.
* My Findings: [Insert your result here, e.g., 'I found that the Norwegian Krone was overvalued by X%...']

**Please write a README.md entry for this project including:**
1. Project Title: Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis.
2. Objective: A professional one-sentence summary of testing the Law of One Price.
3. Methodology: Bullet points explaining that I ingested raw data, calculated implied PPP exchange rates, and computed currency misalignment.
4. Key Findings: A summary of the results I listed above, using economic terms like 'overvaluation' or 'arbitrage'.

Make this sound like a professional analyst wrote it."
